Through its programs and events, the Brecht Forum brings people together across social and cultural boundaries and artistic and academic disciplines to promote critical analysis, creative thinking, collaborative projects and networking in an independent community-level environment.<\/p>\n<p>The cornerstone of our educational conception situates movement-building within a transformative cultural process within society at large. From the beginning, our conception was based on the idea that a fundamental task of the left is to create, within existing society, a counter-hegemonic culture of working people and their allies, who are capable of challenging the capitalist agenda, prefiguring new ways of thinking and of self-organization, as well as creating new ways of relating to each other and nature.<\/p>\n<p>Throughout the year, we offer a wide-ranging program of classes, public lectures and seminars, art exhibitions, performances, popular education workshops, and language classes. These activities are developed in collaboration with the many social movements and the diverse communities of this most cosmopolitan of cities, and our programs bring together leading intellectuals, activists and artists from New York, across the U.S., and internationally.<\/p>\n<p>The Brecht Forum was founded in 1975 as\u00a0<a href="http://solidaritynyc.org/\&quot;http:\/\/brechtforum.org\/nyms\&quot;">The New York Marxist School.<\/a>\u00a0In 1984, the founding collective incorporated as The Brecht Forum with The New York Marxist School as the Forum&#8217;s core project.

Lee and father, George Kim Lee. Following George\u2019s return from his Navy tour of duty during World War II, the farm began supplying New York\u2019s Chinatown with quality Asian produce grown in Melville, Long Island.<\/p>\n<p>The farm was expanded in the late 1950\u2019s to include year round production from Hobe Sound, Florida during the winter months. In 1964 the New York operation was moved to East Moriches, Long Island. Through the 1970\u2019s, \u201980\u2019s,\u00a0and \u201990\u2019s, production and wholesale distribution expanded to Asian markets along the eastern coast from Montreal, Canada, to Miami, Florida, with many cities in between.<\/p>\n<p>As the markets changed and with the passing of some family members, Fred moved the farm operations in 1987 to Peconic, Southold, on the North Fork of Long Island. The moderate climate, offered by the location between The Long Island Sound and Peconic Bay, allows an extended growing season that capitalizes on the fertile, well drained sandy loam soils of eastern Long Island. During the early 1990\u2019s, the product line was expanded greatly to include specialty baby greens, herbs, mesclun and flowers.<\/p>\n<p>Today, Fred and his wife Karen operate the farm with their three children and staff growing more than 100 varietes of specialty vegetables, heirloom tomatoes, baby greens, mesclun, herbs,\u00a0specialty Asian greens and flowers.<\/p>\n<p>Their goal is to provide the highest quality vegetables for their customers by growing unique fresh vegetables that are healthy and pleasing to the palate.<\/p>\n<p>Sang Lee Farms is and will continue to be environmentally responsible.

Barter economies have been in practice throughout history, but the idea of using time as a unit of exchange only appeared shortly after the Industrial Revolution. The origins of time-based currency can be traced both to the American anarchist Josiah Warren, who ran the Cincinnati Time Store from 1827 until 1830, and to the British industrialist and philanthropist Robert Owen, who founded the utopian &#8220;New Harmony&#8221; community. While both systems are based on the principles of mutualism and the labor theory of value, Josiah Warren&#8217;s currency was explicitly pegged to time as a measure of specific goods or labor. For example, 3 hours of carpenter&#8217;s work would be considered equivalent to 3-12 pounds of corn. Meanwhile, Robert Owen&#8217;s currency simply bore an inscription referring to a number of hours, which presumably could be exchanged for however many pounds of corn a farmer would deem adequate or labor of any kind.&#8221;<\/p>\n","latlng":"40.662930,-74.046478","url":"http:\/\/www.e-flux.com\/timebank\/","type":"finance"},

Our weekly community kitchen is a space where parents and neighbors, grandparents, elders and children can get involved in ways that are meaningful to them; cooking, creating, conversating, learning from one another through sharing skills and living life.<\/p>\n<p>The Kitchen Table is the seed of many things we each want to see it grow into, from an intergenerational learning collective to a cooperatively managed building, but for now it is a space where we can bring our children and \u201cunschool\u201d them. For us this means that we understand that our children are constantly learning, and trust them to choose to explore what is important to them. Instead of teaching, we create educational experiences that we share with our kids, allowing them to work and play with us as we grow and make food, create and fix things, have conflicts and resolve them, continually furthering our own learning.<\/p>\n<p>When we allow our children to be their own guides, we learn to see them as whole people with their own passions, not those dictated by a generic curriculum. And by working on our own projects, involving our kids when they are interested and allowing them to play when they are not, our children learn that adults, too, are whole people \u2013 not just parents but artists, activists, gardeners, filmmakers, carpenters, tailors, entrepreneurs, educators, writers, dancers who enjoy living a good life. We fight daily with the pull of the capitalist society in which we live, that tells us it is more important to have stuff and credentials than it is to enjoy life. We value learning, eating and laughing over working over-time and getting good grades, and we believe our children have the right to these values too.<\/p>\n<p>Choosing to avoid institutional life like daycare, preschool and school can be very isolating for families and financially challenging making many unable to compete or even be recognized in the mainstream economy. We resist this isolation by creating opportunities for an alternate economy; a solidarity economy focused on work that has been previously rendered invisible or devalued but is central to our lives, like cooking and caring for our children. We create a barter economy by swapping one useful thing for another, skill sharing or exchanging time-based currency. Through this work we become a community of active, creative, and skilled people pooling and sharing parenting resources such as childcare, clothes, books and principles, philosophy, experience, while cooking healthy and delicious meals together.<\/p>\n<p>We believe that The Kitchen Table is revolutionary on many levels; in our daily lives, our communities, and the larger world. We actively and joyfully resist the idea that segregation by age and family status is healthy or normal, and the assumption that authoritarian schooling is necessary for growing up. We do this work so that our kids and everyone they encounter will question these assumptions and will learn that resisting oppressive institutions and creating community-based alternatives is not only possible, but really, really fun.<\/p>\n","latlng":"40.799114,-73.936821","url":"http:\/\/thekitchentablenyc.wordpress.com\/the-csa\/","type":"learn_play"},

We hope you can join us this summer and many summers to come. Why? Because it means delicious, fresh, affordable vegetables grown right here in Red Hook, Brooklyn.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So what, you ask, is a CSA?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Traditionally, Community Supported Agriculture projects were bridges built between urban consumers and rural farmers. They provided a pathway to bring high-quality organic food to a community while also supporting local farmers.<\/p>\n<p>The Red Hook CSA is unique among urban CSAs because the farm you invest in is right here in our community. In fact, you can go and see it: Just walk down to Columbia and Beard streets.<\/p>\n<p>And your farm provides long-term educational programming to local teens and school children. Meaning that while you are purchasing high-quality food for your family, improving your diet and shrinking your impact on the environment, you are also making an investment in the future of Red Hook.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How does it work?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>At the beginning of the season, you buy a \u201cshare\u201d of the harvest. You can either get a full share, good for a family or two vegetarians, or a small share, which is better for couples and singles.<\/p>\n<p>Each week you pick up your bounty on Saturdays between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. at the Red Hook Community Farm on Columbia and Beard streets. Unlike some CSAs, your harvest is not pre-boxed for you. Instead, you visit the CSA farmstand and choose your own vegetables based on what is included in that week\u2019s share.<\/p>\n<p>Each week you take home roughly six to ten items worth $11 to $20, depending on your share option.<\/p>\n<p>There is also a selection of other shares available. A fruit share, which includes berries, peaches, grapes, apples, plums and more is offered. Also available is a weekly egg share.<\/p>\n<p>Shares are offered on a sliding scale payment of 25% to 50% less for low-income members. Work shares are also available. We accept checks, credit and debit cards, WIC Fruit and Vegetable Coupons, and Farmers Market Nutrition WIC and Senior coupons.<\/p>\n<p><em>\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n","latlng":"40.672062,-74.009377","url":"http:\/\/redhookcsa.com\/","type":"food"},

Neither by itself is enough, but in their combination lies our hope for the future<\/strong>.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Senator Robert F. Kennedy<\/strong><br \/>\n344 Monroe Street<br \/>\nBedford Stuyvesant<\/p>\n<p>In 1964, with the cooperation of Senator Jacob K. Javits and Mayor John W. Lindsay, Senator Robert F. Kennedy set into motion a round of legislative action that created the Special Impact Program, an amendment to the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964. He announced a seven point action plan that would serve as a national model for community development. The plan called for the formation of the Bedford Stuyvesant Renewal and Rehabilitation Corporation and the Development Services Corporation, involving assistance from some of the foremost leaders of the American business community.<\/p>\n<p>Under the leadership of Judge Thomas R. Jones, in 1967 the Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation (Restoration) was formally established to consolidate and carry forward these efforts. Deputy Police Commissioner Franklin A. Thomas, an original board member of the Bedford Stuyvesant Renewal and Rehabilitation Corporation and later to become President of the Ford Foundation, was elected as Restoration\u2019s first president. Initial funding support came from the Taconic Foundation, the Rockefeller Brothers Foundation, the Edgar M. Stern Family Fund, the J.M. Kaplan Fund and the Ford Foundation.<\/p>\n<p>One year later, Restoration purchased an abandoned milk bottling plant in the heart of Bedford Stuyvesant, Sheffield Farms, to serve as its new corporate headquarters. Renovations soon began to create what is now known as Restoration Plaza. Completed in 1972, today this 300,000 square feet commercial plaza is home to Restoration\u2019s headquarters, the historic Billie Holiday Theatre, the Skylight Gallery and scores of local businesses, non-profits and government agencies, including a post office, local branches of JPMorgan Chase, Washington Mutual Bank and Citibank, Super Foodtown, a satellite campus of the College of New Rochelle and Assemblywoman Annette Robinson\u2019s office.<\/p>\n<p>Since 1967, Restoration has catalyzed enormous economic, cultural, and educational improvements in Central Brooklyn. Just a sampling of our accomplishments include:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing<\/strong>: Restoration has constructed or renovated 2,200 units of housing, including homeownership and rental. The corporation has also beautifully repaired the facades of 150 homes on 150 blocks and provided $60 million in mortgage financing to nearly 1500 homeowners. As the height of its activity, Restoration was the second largest real estate owner in Brooklyn after the City of New York and controlled over $12 million in fixed assets. Today, Restoration remains committed to creating a mixed income community where households of all income levels have access to quality housing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Economic Development<\/strong>: Restoration&#8217;s programs have attracted more than $500 million in investments to Central Brooklyn: placed over 20,000 youth and adults in jobs; and catalyzed physical and economic improvements to Fulton Street.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Arts and Culture<\/strong>: Our Youth Arts Academy remains the only comprehensive arts education institution in Bedford Stuyvesant. Together with art resident the Noel Pointer Foundation, the Academy , offers instruction in dance, music, and theatre to over 400 students ages 3-18 each year. The Skylight Gallery continues to feature artwork across media, showcasing the work of some 100 artists each year and drawing an average of 2,000 visitors. The Billie Holiday Theatre is still the only resource of its kind in Central Brooklyn, serving 30,000 people annually over a 36-week season. Winner of numerous Obie and AUDELCO awards, the Theatre is fertile ground for aspiring theatre professionals and an incredible community resource for residents interested in enjoying quality theatrical performances by critically acclaimed playwrights.<\/p>\n","latlng":"40.680187,-73.945969","url":"http:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps\/place?ftid=0x89c25b857944e063","type":"finance"},

              <h2>Worker Cooperatives</h2>
<h3>What’s the Goal?</h3>
<p>Worker cooperatives seek to meet community needs and create livelihoods through businesses and organizations that are owned and democratically controlled by their workers.</p>
<h3>How Do They Work?</h3>
<p>Structured in many different ways, they are united by the principle of worker control via collective ownership and a democratic “one member, one vote” or consensus decision-making structure. Both risks and the profits are shared among worker-owners.</p>
<h3>Successes</h3>
<p>There are an estimated 500+ successful worker cooperatives in the U.S. Worker coops generally have higher rates of employee retention and workplace satisfaction than capitalist businesses. Some studies have also suggested that worker cooperatives have a slightly higher rate of success than other types of small businesses. You can find out more via the U.S. Federation of Worker Cooperatives, American Worker Cooperative, and the NYC Network of Worker Co-operatives.</p>

              <h2>Consumer Cooperatives</h2>
<h3>What’s the Goal?</h3>
<p>Consumer Cooperatives are structures through which consumers democratically organize to purchase and distribute goods (such as food) and services among each other.</p>
<h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
<p>The business is owned by consumer-members who buy into the coop through membership fees and/or sweat equity and who benefit (in theory, if not always in practice) from lower prices and/or dividends from the business’ earnings. The coop is typically run by members elected to a Board of Directors and often by managers hired by that Board. Some consumer cooperatives are owned and run jointly by both the consumers and the workers. These coops seek to build democratic participation into every level of their operation, from the membership meeting to the stockroom.</p>
<h3>Successes</h3>
<p>There are thousands of consumer coops in the U.S.. Though cooperatively owned natural food stores are the most well known examples, housing coops, buying clubs, mutual insurance cooperatives and health care coops are all examples of cooperative consumer self-organization. You can find out more via the Food Co-op Initiative and the Park Slope Food Co-op.</p>

              <h2>Participatory Budgeting</h2>
<h3>What’s the Goal?</h3>
<p>The goal of participatory budgeting is to democratize the process of governmental budgeting.</p>
<h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
<p>Participatory budgeting can occur in three different stages. The public and various civic groups are included in a) analysis and formulation of budgetary priorities, b) monitoring budgetary expenditures and making sure that they are consistent with the budgetary priorities and c) monitoring the delivery of public services. This process attempts to create a space for greater democratic participation throughout the budgeting process.</p>
<h3>Successes</h3>
<p>The most prominent success of Participatory Budgeting has been in Porto Alegre, Brazil, adopted while under the control of the Worker’s Party (PT). Various other forms of Participatory Budgeting have been implemented in Canada, India, Ireland, Uganda the United States and South Africa, often at a municipal level. You can learn more via the Participatory Budgeting Project.</p>

              <h2>Barter Clubs</h2>
<h3>What’s the Goal?</h3>
<p>Barter Clubs are organized groups that facilitate the direct exchange of goods and services between people. People meet up and trade things without using money. Community-based barter clubs are not about haggling or just getting a deal. Most small-scale barter clubs are about relationships and mutual aid: the voluntary reciprocal exchange of resources and services for mutual benefit.</p>
<h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
<p>The simplest way to start a barter club is to make a list of “goods/services offered” and a list of “goods/services needed.” You can start a clothing, food, or other good/service swap event really easily! The group ClothingSwap.com offers tips.</p>
<p>At the most elaborate and large­scale end are nationally­ linked institutions such as the barter markets (clubes de trueque) that have emerged in Argentina since the 2001 financial crisis. In these markets,­­ of which there are more than 100 throughout the country­­, people exchange a huge array of goods and services using an in­ house “barter currency” as a kind of IOU that circulates as a medium of exchange. In the absence of a viable national money system, these barter clubs have been essential for the survival of many thousands of struggling families.</p>
<h3>Successes</h3>
<p>In New York City alone, there are many barter clubs: OurGoods.org (a resource sharing site for artists and activists), BK Swappers (a Brooklyn-based homemade foodie swap), and the Rock Dove Collective (a radical community health exchange network). By identifying the skills and assets that are valuable to other members (like local produce, fresh meals, learning, childcare, and artwork), barter clubs honor motivations other than competition and profit-making and build local relationships of mutual aid, trust, and interdependence.</p>

              <h2>Credit Unions</h2>
<h3>What’s the Goal?</h3>
<p>Created to provide access to credit and financial services on the part of under-served communities, credit unions are member-owned, member-controlled, not-for-profit organizations.</p>
<h3>How Do They Work?</h3>
<p>Though many of them try very hard to look just like capitalist banks, they are fundamentally different in their operation. Capitalist banks exist to make a profit from the money they borrow and lend, funneling this profit to owners and investors. Credit Unions, on the other hand, exist only to serve their member-owners. Profits generated from credit union activities are returned to the organization to enhance or support services for the membership.</p>
<h3>Successes</h3>
<p>Like any “democratic” institution credit unions are only as good as their membership makes them. Credit unions without an organized progressive membership fall short of their potential. Credit unions with such an active membership (such as the Santa Cruz Community Credit Union in CA) can provide tremendous resources for community development and social justice efforts. You can learn more via the National Federation of Community Development Credit Unions.</p>

              <h2>Intentional Communities</h2>
<h3>What’s the Goal?</h3>
<p>Like-minded people form intentional communities in order to live and work together in cooperation for shared goals. They collectively own the properties they use for their living and working.</p>
<h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
<p>Intentional Communities have, for many centuries, been places where idealists have come together to create a better world. Communities come in all shapes and sizes, and share many similar challenges — such as defining membership, succeeding financially, distributing resources, making decisions, raising children, dividing work equitably, and choosing a standard of living. Many wrestle with questions about right livelihood, spiritual expression, land use, and the role of service in our lives. Virtually all communities share a common root value of cooperation.</p>
<h3>Successes</h3>
<p>Although there are thousands of intentional communities in existence today, and many others in the formative stages, many people are unaware of them or the roots from which they spring. For comprehensive information, check out the Fellowship for Intentional Community.</p>

              <p>The solidarity economy meets human needs through economic activities–like the production and exchange of goods and services–that reinforce values of justice, ecological sustainability, cooperation, and democracy. This animated short explains what the solidarity economy framework is and how housing co-ops and community land trusts, worker co-ops, community supported agriculture, and credit unions help to meet everyone&#8217;s needs within it.</p>

      <h2>The solidarity economy includes a wide array of economic practices and initiatives but they all share common values that stand in stark contrast to the values of the dominant economy.</h2>
<p>Instead of enforcing a culture of cut-throat competition, they build cultures and communities of cooperation. Rather than isolating us from one another, they foster relationships of mutual support and solidarity. In place of centralized structures of control, they move us towards shared responsibility and democratic decision-making. Instead of imposing a single global monoculture, they strengthen the diversity of local cultures and environments. Instead of prioritizing profit over all else, they encourage a commitment to shared humanity best expressed in social, economic, and environmental justice.</p>

<p>The New York City solidarity economy includes many, if not all, of the practices listed above plus some we haven’t even discovered yet! While it rarely turns up in the news, New Yorkers are using solidarity practices to create jobs, produce food, house their families, educate themselves, entertain their communities, access healthcare, and restore the environment.  In fact, many have been doing so for generations. The solidarity economy isn’t a far off utopia, but is instead a force already changing lives in our communities.</p>

    <div class="main-content">
      <p><strong>Move Your Money!</strong></p>
<p>While many people are inspired to move their money out of corporate banks, not everyone is really sure what to do with it. You can’t hide it under a mattress, of course. Credit unions can be confusing and many banks aren’t exactly forthcoming about their practices. Here’s what you need to know:</p>
<p><strong>Credit Unions:</strong></p>
<p>Credit unions are cooperative financial institutions that offer many (if not all) of the same services you would get at a regular bank. The difference is that when you open an account you become a MEMBER and an OWNER. That means it’s up to all of those banking there to keep the organization accountable. Of course, you can just open an account and forget about it, but if you choose to get involved you can join a committee or run for the democratically elected Board of Directors. Whereas banks have SHAREHOLDERS (outside investors to whom they are accountable), credit unions have MEMBERS. Your money is backed by the same Federal guarantee as a bank, but instead of FDIC it’s through NCUA (http://www.ncua.gov/). You’re covered and it’s all good. They also tend to have an advantage in terms of interest rates in savings accounts or loans, because their interest is to benefit YOU and the other members, not the shareholders. Many also offer a wide range of great, free financial classes and management tools in terms of your personal banking and using that specific credit union.</p>
<p>Credit unions also focus on specific communities. They have strict limitations on who they can serve. This is where it can get difficult for some people to find a credit union to join. You must be within the <strong>field of membership </strong>in order to qualify for membership. It is specific to each institution. One way to think of it is this: you’re joining a community when you open an account. It is very difficult for credit unions to expand their fields of membership–the banks are interested in keeping them small so they don’t threaten their profits, so a lot of lobbying goes on–hence why there isn’t a national credit union we can all run and join right now. Look into field of membership requirements to see if you can join.</p>
<p>Credit unions are not all perfect just because they’re cooperative. Some may not be able to meet all of your needs. Check out the services they make available. Don’t get angry with them if they can’t meet your every expectation. They do not have the resources of the corporate banks. Expect it to be a different experience, be open-minded, and consider opening a savings account at a credit union if they can’t meet your needs for a checking account. Seriously. It’s also worth noting most credit unions are actually part of a national credit union network. (They have a website and app too, so it’s easy to find out which ones.) This network allows you to deposit or withdraw money at any of the participating Credit Union’s branches/ATMs basically like it was your own. It will go straight into or out of your account no problem.</p>
<p>Last, Community Development Credit Unions (CDCUs) are focused on investing in communities which have been marginalized. You may already know that banks used to circle whole areas of city maps, in a process called red-lining, and then refuse to make loans to those areas. You won’t be surprised to learn the people in those areas were often people of color, immigrants, or low-income. Many of those neighborhoods are without banking services—people have to go MILES outside of their community in order to access a bank account. To address this, and to begin to develop economic security in those areas, CDCUS were formed and continue to fill the gap.<strong>If you qualify to put your money in a CDCU you will be able to do the most good with it. </strong>No question. That’s the best choice. You can find a list of them for every state here: http://www.cdcu.coop/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=1530</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Banks:</strong></p>
<p>Not every bank is evil just because it has shareholders. Some do great things within this framework. They also are often able to offer additional services than credit unions, so they may be better suited to your needs. They fall into a few categories.</p>
<p>Some, like the labor bank Amalgamated, were formed to meet the needs of a specific community (in this case that of union members.) They offer free ATMs in every Duane Reade AND they are actively challenging corporate behavior as shareholders. There is a whole wing of Amalgamated devoted to shareholder advocacy, which means they push corporations on workers rights, among other issues.</p>
<p>Similarly, there are online banks like New Resource Bank, which is focused on environmental issues. There are more–you just gotta dig a bit.</p>
<p>There are also community development banks–which like CDCUs focus on low-moderate income community economic development. This <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_development_bank">Wikipedia article </a>explains them well, and gives a few examples: .  The most famous one was Shorebank, which had successfully generated capital for a number of projects, but it closed last year. You might look into these options.</p>
<p>Other banks are small–like community banks in rural areas–but they can easily be bought by corporate banks. If you don’t want to have to move your money twice it is best to avoid them.</p>
<p><strong>Go move your money!</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 13px;"><span style="color: #222222;">We&#8217;re a collective of organizers and academics who promote, connect, and support New York City’s solidarity economy. Solidarity economy practices utilize values of justice, democracy, cooperation, and mutualism to meet community needs. Our collective renders these practices visible, through mapping and filmmaking, and brings the sectors of the solidarity economy into greater cooperation with each other for enhanced economic and political power through education, organizing, and research. </span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 13px;">Our vision is a vibrant and growing movement to provide greater economic security, improved health, and increased democracy for our communities.</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"></h3>
<h3 dir="ltr">We hope to:</h3>
<p>1. Make the strong solidarity economy practices that already exist in New York City visible. (Check out our map and our films.)</p>
<p dir="ltr">2. Bring the various sectors of the solidarity economy into conversation with each other for collaboration and mutual benefit. We want to build both economic and political power.</p>
<p dir="ltr">3. Grow the solidarity economy by driving more traffic into existing initiatives while inspiring and supporting the development of new ones.</p>
<p dir="ltr">4. Create democratic and cooperative cultures to replace those of competition and hierarchy which characterize corporate capitalism. It isn’t enough to just have a “green” business or “social” enterprise–we have to radically change the way we relate to each other and the purpose of economic activity.</p>
<p dir="ltr">5. Bridge gaps between social justice grassroots economic community development movements. Contact us at info (at) solidaritynyc (dot) org.</p>

      <h2 dir="ltr">SolidarityNYC seeks to support, connect, and promote our solidarity economy through mapping, research, organizing, and education.</h2>
<h3 dir="ltr">Mapping</h3>
<p dir="ltr">One of the primary difficulties in raising awareness and support for the solidarity economy lies in its invisibility. While New Yorkers have been engaged in solidarity economic practices and relationships since long before the region was known as New York, many of these practices are submerged within the dominant capitalist economy or simply aren’t commercialized or marketed. Our goal is to lift up these practices by creating a NYC solidarity economy map to provide practical information about businesses and initiatives in our communities.  Our map is both conceptual and practical&#8211; you can use it to find local produce or housing collectives in your community or to learn more about the ways solidarity economics operate in your own life. Making these practices and models visible and understood is an important  step towards encouraging policies to support solidarity economy efforts across the five boroughs.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Research  and Organizing</h3>
<p dir="ltr">While there are many organizations and businesses that comprise the solidarity economy they are without a shared vehicle for engaging community members and policymakers. (Compare this to the many corporate associations and networks organized to lobby our municipal, state, and federal government.) SolidarityNYC addresses this gap by conducting participatory research to assess the needs and goals of the groups that comprise NYC’s solidarity economy. Our hope is to bring together a diverse group of representatives to form a democratic body to lend a collective voice to our many disparate efforts.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Education</h3>
<p>Most of us grow up within educational systems that assume our current dominant economy is a fundamental truth which cannot be altered. The consensus within our culture is all too often “it isn’t perfect, but it’s the best we’ve got.” The reality is our economic relationships are much more complex than those which register on GDP reports or consumer indexes. SolidarityNYC is committed to providing educational programs and resources that challenge prevailing assumptions and demonstrate that alternative economic practices are available to us all. We also partner with allies to present programs focused on specific practices or skills necessary to a viable solidarity economy, such as how to establish a worker cooperative or how to create a democratic culture within an organization. If you are interested in a workshop, training, or presentation on the solidarity economy or a related topic please email us at info (at) solidaritynyc (dot) org.</p>
