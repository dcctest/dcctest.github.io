The children are then taught outside about gardening and food and are allowed to harvest and plant in the garden.

They are encouraged to only bring reusable containers and things with no packaging. They then receive tickets that they can collect as a class to earn a party. This club also won $1,000 from the Reuse Award which goes to schools that most effectively reuse items from Green Clean-Out, sponsored by the CPS. Winners were selected by judges from City of Chicago Department of Environment and CPS Environmental Affairs. Some of the reused items included spiral notebooks, crayons, markers, glue, and other classroom supplies. Those that could not be reused were either recycled or donated.",

NFPN member organizations recruited applicants for Casa on the Vine through their various food pantry programs. Successful applicants received a container garden start-up set of two 20-gallon containers filled with soil and compost to grow tomato plants and three 5-gallon buckets to grow a variety of peppers.\n\nEmployed as Casa on the Vine Specialists, four youth from La Casa Nortes Solid Ground program prepared, delivered and planted the container gardens at 31 separate locations (households and community organizations) throughout the Humboldt Park neighborhood. To receive their official Casa on the Vine Specialist credentials the youth took three weeks of extensive training covering topics of urban agriculture, customer service, community engagement, and container preparation. In the span of 9 days at the end of May, youth delivered nearly 4 tons of soil, planted 62 tomato containers and 93 peppers, connecting over 80 Humboldt Park community residents with direct access to their own produce.",

Deliveries to the pantry are made on Sundays. The garden is situated on a previously abandoned lot of state owned property on the edge of the Kennedy expressway, on the corner of Ainslie Ave. and Leclaire St. on the north side of Chicago. The Jefferson Park Community Association wanted to do something with the space for some time and in 2008 the idea of having a garden there was mentioned to Heinz Nogly, a scout leader in Cub Scout Pack 3963 which meets at Eden Church, which is just a block away from the space. The idea was passed along to Andy Brecklin, a leader in Pack 3963 who was also involved with Boy Scout Troop 840. Andy, who is still heavily involved in the upkeep and organizing for the garden, then passed the idea along to his son who went on to start the garden. The garden was named for Olive Borgardt in 2012. The garden distributes food grown by neighborhood gardeners through a local food pantry. Neighborhood volunteers have access to the garden and are now trying to take full ownership of the garden. They grow vegetable for the food pantry, native species towards the highway.",
          "Description": "All of the food grown in the garden is donated to the Northwest Church of Christ, located at 4602 N. Kilbourn. This pantry serves 70-80 local families.",

Educational workshops were provided as well to teach residents how to plant a tree and the value growing trees like beautifying the city, purifying the air and water, providing a habitat for native species, absorbing storm water, slowing down runoff to the sewer system, and helping to save money on heating and air conditioning bills by providing shade and cutting wind.\n\nThey organized a subsidized tree sale, held on October 23rd, for Logan Square and Avondale residents on the Southwest Corner of Milwaukee and Logan Boulevard.

They also put bird houses or bee homes in them so that native birds and bees can use the corners. \nA long term initiative of the Greening of North Center community is to make the community completely sustainable within 5 years.

STEP courses shift according to student interest and community need and thus far have focused on biodiesel, water, and food systems.\nCUERP intends for Loyola to be a green leader in Chicago, with plans to reduce the universitys environmental footprint by forty percent. New buildings, like the Richard J. Klarchek Information Commons, exhibit the latest green technology, from recycled carpet to advanced heating and cooling technology that reduces energy use by fifty percent. CUERP intends to meet a 40% reduction in its footprint through enhanced recycling and composting programs, banning bottled water, facilitating used furniture circulation, and improving the colleges transportation system to limit the use of cars.\nWhile Service Learning has always been essential to a Loyola education, CUERP aims to spread sustainability from the campus to the community. Outreach for the Rogers Park and Edgewater communities includes bringing biodiesel to area high schools, educating with a weekly radio show on the environment, Chicago Footprints .

At our monthly Repair Clinics, local tinkerers and handy-folk volunteer their time and services to neighbors in need of repair. Our goals are to get people thinking twice before discarding objects that need a little elbow grease, and to bring people together.\n\nIn addition to hosting Repair Clinics at Edgewater coffee shop Kitchen Sink, Community Glue Workshop will hold skill-sharing workshops and other programs to foster handiwork skills and inspire some fixin\u2019 up at home as well. Everyone is encouraged to participate, so grab your tool box and the busted lamp that\u2019s been in the closet for a year, and head to our next event!",
