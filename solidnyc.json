Through its programs and events, the Brecht Forum brings people together across social and cultural boundaries and artistic and academic disciplines to promote critical analysis, creative thinking, collaborative projects and networking in an independent community-level environment.</p>\n<p>The cornerstone of our educational conception situates movement-building within a transformative cultural process within society at large. From the beginning, our conception was based on the idea that a fundamental task of the left is to create, within existing society, a counter-hegemonic culture of working people and their allies, who are capable of challenging the capitalist agenda, prefiguring new ways of thinking and of self-organization, as well as creating new ways of relating to each other and nature.</p>\n<p>Throughout the year, we offer a wide-ranging program of classes, public lectures and seminars, art exhibitions, performances, popular education workshops, and language classes. These activities are developed in collaboration with the many social movements and the diverse communities of this most cosmopolitan of cities, and our programs bring together leading intellectuals, activists and artists from New York, across the U.S., and internationally.</p>\n<p>The Brecht Forum was founded in 1975 as <a href=\"http://brechtforum.org/nyms\">The New York Marxist School.</a> In 1984, the founding collective incorporated as The Brecht Forum with The New York Marxist School as the Forum&#8217;s core project. Additional projects include  <a href=\"http://brechtforum.org/institute\">The Institute for Popular Education</a>, founded in 1990 iin collaboration with the <a href=\"http://www.toplab.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Theater of the Oppressed Laboratory</a> &amp; Arts at the Brecht which includes ongoing arts programming in collaboration with such projects as Neues Kabarett, an experimental jazz series initiated in 1998, <a href=\"http://www.strikeanywhere.info/\" target=\"_blank\">Strike Anywhere Theater Ensemble</a>, and The Ground Floor Collective.</p>\n<p><strong>Registration &amp; Fees</strong></p>\n<p>Most of our activities have a sliding scale suggested donation and no one is turned away for inability to pay. As these funds only cover a portion of our costs, we ask all who can afford to give the higher amount to do so. Pre-registration is encouraged, but is not required except when indicated. <strong>Become a Brecht Forum SUBSCRIBER!</strong> With a pledge of $15 per month or more you can become a Brecht Forum Subscriber and receive a Subscriber Card entitling you to free admission to all classes (with the exception of language classes), lectures and discounts on selected seminars &amp; special events.&#8221;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n",

Lee and father, George Kim Lee. Following George’s return from his Navy tour of duty during World War II, the farm began supplying New York’s Chinatown with quality Asian produce grown in Melville, Long Island.</p>\n<p>The farm was expanded in the late 1950’s to include year round production from Hobe Sound, Florida during the winter months. In 1964 the New York operation was moved to East Moriches, Long Island. Through the 1970’s, ’80’s, and ’90’s, production and wholesale distribution expanded to Asian markets along the eastern coast from Montreal, Canada, to Miami, Florida, with many cities in between.</p>\n<p>As the markets changed and with the passing of some family members, Fred moved the farm operations in 1987 to Peconic, Southold, on the North Fork of Long Island. The moderate climate, offered by the location between The Long Island Sound and Peconic Bay, allows an extended growing season that capitalizes on the fertile, well drained sandy loam soils of eastern Long Island. During the early 1990’s, the product line was expanded greatly to include specialty baby greens, herbs, mesclun and flowers.</p>\n<p>Today, Fred and his wife Karen operate the farm with their three children and staff growing more than 100 varietes of specialty vegetables, heirloom tomatoes, baby greens, mesclun, herbs, specialty Asian greens and flowers.</p>\n<p>Their goal is to provide the highest quality vegetables for their customers by growing unique fresh vegetables that are healthy and pleasing to the palate.</p>\n<p>Sang Lee Farms is and will continue to be environmentally responsible. They will accomplish this goal by cultivating their vegetables and herbs <strong>Organically</strong> utilizing sustainable agricultural practices and integrated pest management.</p>\n<p>Sang Lee Farms will use only organically approved materials and production techniques to provide wholesome food for their community and customers.  Sang Lee Farms is a Certified Organic Vegetable Farm by NOFA-NY Certified Organic, LLC. and will continue to cultivate their produce under the National Organic Production Standards to maintain certification with NOFA-NY.&#8221;</p>\n",

				"content" : "<p>Banking and finance: time bank</p>\n<p>http://www.e-flux.com/timebank/</p>\n<p>From the website:</p>\n<p>&#8220;Time banking is not barter. Barter economies have been in practice throughout history, but the idea of using time as a unit of exchange only appeared shortly after the Industrial Revolution. The origins of time-based currency can be traced both to the American anarchist Josiah Warren, who ran the Cincinnati Time Store from 1827 until 1830, and to the British industrialist and philanthropist Robert Owen, who founded the utopian &#8220;New Harmony&#8221; community. While both systems are based on the principles of mutualism and the labor theory of value, Josiah Warren&#8217;s currency was explicitly pegged to time as a measure of specific goods or labor. For example, 3 hours of carpenter&#8217;s work would be considered equivalent to 3-12 pounds of corn. Meanwhile, Robert Owen&#8217;s currency simply bore an inscription referring to a number of hours, which presumably could be exchanged for however many pounds of corn a farmer would deem adequate or labor of any kind.&#8221;</p>\n",

As a result, EHBCC received a $200,000 grant and an additional $300,000 for the EHBCC loan fund. In 2003, EHBCC was awarded another two-year $500,000 grant.</li>\n<li><strong>NYS Empire Zone Administrator: </strong>In December 2000, EHBCC was designated the East Harlem Empire Zone Administrator by the New York State Empire State Development Corporation (ESDC) and the New York City Department of Small Business Services (DSBS). This makes EHBCC the certifying agency for businesses in East Harlem seeking Empire Zone benefits. In 2003, EHBCC led the successful campaign to expand the Zone&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

Through the distribution of our short documentary programs, media literacy/video production workshops, community screenings and grassroots advocacy, PTTV works to expose and challenge the corporate control of media. Because of the bias and misrepresentation of issues in mainstream media it is critical to include diverse perspectives in the process of making media. PTTV strives to increase awareness of how media can be used to affect social change. A public that can strategically and creatively use the media is necessary for a more equitable and healthy democracy.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n",

				"content" : "<p>Food: Community supported agriculture</p>\n<p>http://thekitchentablenyc.wordpress.com/the-csa/</p>\n<p>From the website:</p>\n<p>The Kitchen Table is a community kitchen and parenting collective for unschooling families committed to social change.</p>\n<p>We came up with the name The Kitchen Table as a way to keep our work focused around where we live and where we gather naturally. Our weekly community kitchen is a space where parents and neighbors, grandparents, elders and children can get involved in ways that are meaningful to them; cooking, creating, conversating, learning from one another through sharing skills and living life.</p>\n<p>The Kitchen Table is the seed of many things we each want to see it grow into, from an intergenerational learning collective to a cooperatively managed building, but for now it is a space where we can bring our children and “unschool” them. For us this means that we understand that our children are constantly learning, and trust them to choose to explore what is important to them. Instead of teaching, we create educational experiences that we share with our kids, allowing them to work and play with us as we grow and make food, create and fix things, have conflicts and resolve them, continually furthering our own learning.</p>\n<p>When we allow our children to be their own guides, we learn to see them as whole people with their own passions, not those dictated by a generic curriculum. And by working on our own projects, involving our kids when they are interested and allowing them to play when they are not, our children learn that adults, too, are whole people – not just parents but artists, activists, gardeners, filmmakers, carpenters, tailors, entrepreneurs, educators, writers, dancers who enjoy living a good life. We fight daily with the pull of the capitalist society in which we live, that tells us it is more important to have stuff and credentials than it is to enjoy life. We value learning, eating and laughing over working over-time and getting good grades, and we believe our children have the right to these values too.</p>\n<p>Choosing to avoid institutional life like daycare, preschool and school can be very isolating for families and financially challenging making many unable to compete or even be recognized in the mainstream economy. We resist this isolation by creating opportunities for an alternate economy; a solidarity economy focused on work that has been previously rendered invisible or devalued but is central to our lives, like cooking and caring for our children. We create a barter economy by swapping one useful thing for another, skill sharing or exchanging time-based currency. Through this work we become a community of active, creative, and skilled people pooling and sharing parenting resources such as childcare, clothes, books and principles, philosophy, experience, while cooking healthy and delicious meals together.</p>\n<p>We believe that The Kitchen Table is revolutionary on many levels; in our daily lives, our communities, and the larger world. We actively and joyfully resist the idea that segregation by age and family status is healthy or normal, and the assumption that authoritarian schooling is necessary for growing up. We do this work so that our kids and everyone they encounter will question these assumptions and will learn that resisting oppressive institutions and creating community-based alternatives is not only possible, but really, really fun.</p>\n",

We hope you can join us this summer and many summers to come. Why? Because it means delicious, fresh, affordable vegetables grown right here in Red Hook, Brooklyn.</p>\n<p><strong>So what, you ask, is a CSA?</strong></p>\n<p>Traditionally, Community Supported Agriculture projects were bridges built between urban consumers and rural farmers. They provided a pathway to bring high-quality organic food to a community while also supporting local farmers.</p>\n<p>The Red Hook CSA is unique among urban CSAs because the farm you invest in is right here in our community. In fact, you can go and see it: Just walk down to Columbia and Beard streets.</p>\n<p>And your farm provides long-term educational programming to local teens and school children. Meaning that while you are purchasing high-quality food for your family, improving your diet and shrinking your impact on the environment, you are also making an investment in the future of Red Hook.</p>\n<p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>\n<p>At the beginning of the season, you buy a “share” of the harvest. You can either get a full share, good for a family or two vegetarians, or a small share, which is better for couples and singles.</p>\n<p>Each week you pick up your bounty on Saturdays between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. at the Red Hook Community Farm on Columbia and Beard streets. Unlike some CSAs, your harvest is not pre-boxed for you. Instead, you visit the CSA farmstand and choose your own vegetables based on what is included in that week’s share.</p>\n<p>Each week you take home roughly six to ten items worth $11 to $20, depending on your share option.</p>\n<p>There is also a selection of other shares available. A fruit share, which includes berries, peaches, grapes, apples, plums and more is offered. Also available is a weekly egg share.</p>\n<p>Shares are offered on a sliding scale payment of 25% to 50% less for low-income members. Work shares are also available. We accept checks, credit and debit cards, WIC Fruit and Vegetable Coupons, and Farmers Market Nutrition WIC and Senior coupons.</p>\n<p><em> </em></p>\n",

Neither by itself is enough, but in their combination lies our hope for the future</strong>.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Senator Robert F. Kennedy</strong><br />\n344 Monroe Street<br />\nBedford Stuyvesant</p>\n<p>In 1964, with the cooperation of Senator Jacob K. Javits and Mayor John W. Lindsay, Senator Robert F. Kennedy set into motion a round of legislative action that created the Special Impact Program, an amendment to the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964. He announced a seven point action plan that would serve as a national model for community development. The plan called for the formation of the Bedford Stuyvesant Renewal and Rehabilitation Corporation and the Development Services Corporation, involving assistance from some of the foremost leaders of the American business community.</p>\n<p>Under the leadership of Judge Thomas R. Jones, in 1967 the Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation (Restoration) was formally established to consolidate and carry forward these efforts. Deputy Police Commissioner Franklin A. Thomas, an original board member of the Bedford Stuyvesant Renewal and Rehabilitation Corporation and later to become President of the Ford Foundation, was elected as Restoration’s first president. Initial funding support came from the Taconic Foundation, the Rockefeller Brothers Foundation, the Edgar M. Stern Family Fund, the J.M. Kaplan Fund and the Ford Foundation.</p>\n<p>One year later, Restoration purchased an abandoned milk bottling plant in the heart of Bedford Stuyvesant, Sheffield Farms, to serve as its new corporate headquarters. Renovations soon began to create what is now known as Restoration Plaza. Completed in 1972, today this 300,000 square feet commercial plaza is home to Restoration’s headquarters, the historic Billie Holiday Theatre, the Skylight Gallery and scores of local businesses, non-profits and government agencies, including a post office, local branches of JPMorgan Chase, Washington Mutual Bank and Citibank, Super Foodtown, a satellite campus of the College of New Rochelle and Assemblywoman Annette Robinson’s office.</p>\n<p>Since 1967, Restoration has catalyzed enormous economic, cultural, and educational improvements in Central Brooklyn. Just a sampling of our accomplishments include:</p>\n<p><strong>Housing</strong>: Restoration has constructed or renovated 2,200 units of housing, including homeownership and rental. The corporation has also beautifully repaired the facades of 150 homes on 150 blocks and provided $60 million in mortgage financing to nearly 1500 homeowners. As the height of its activity, Restoration was the second largest real estate owner in Brooklyn after the City of New York and controlled over $12 million in fixed assets. Today, Restoration remains committed to creating a mixed income community where households of all income levels have access to quality housing.</p>\n<p><strong>Economic Development</strong>: Restoration&#8217;s programs have attracted more than $500 million in investments to Central Brooklyn: placed over 20,000 youth and adults in jobs; and catalyzed physical and economic improvements to Fulton Street.</p>\n<p><strong>Arts and Culture</strong>: Our Youth Arts Academy remains the only comprehensive arts education institution in Bedford Stuyvesant. Together with art resident the Noel Pointer Foundation, the Academy , offers instruction in dance, music, and theatre to over 400 students ages 3-18 each year. The Skylight Gallery continues to feature artwork across media, showcasing the work of some 100 artists each year and drawing an average of 2,000 visitors. The Billie Holiday Theatre is still the only resource of its kind in Central Brooklyn, serving 30,000 people annually over a 36-week season. Winner of numerous Obie and AUDELCO awards, the Theatre is fertile ground for aspiring theatre professionals and an incredible community resource for residents interested in enjoying quality theatrical performances by critically acclaimed playwrights.</p>\n",
