The devastating storm, which destroyed many businesses, left tens of thousands of New York and New Jersey residents unemployed.Until now, official rebuilding efforts have been dominated by outside developers. In the spring of 2012, community members teamed up with volunteers from Occupy Sandy and The Working World to form WORCs: Worker Owned Rockaway Cooperatives. Together, we held a 12-week cooperative business course and directed economic investment to community members who began to plan and develop their own local, democratically-controlled businesses. Already, two new worker-owned businesses have opened: the Roca Mia construction cooperative and La Mies bakery, and more are planned to open this spring if we are able to continue our work.",

				"Description" : "From the Website: The program for the development of Bedford Stuyvesant will combine the best of community action with the best of the private enterprise system. Neither by itself is enough, but in their combination lies our hope for the future Senator Robert F. Kennedy. In 1964, with the cooperation of Senator Jacob K. Javits and Mayor John W. Lindsay, Senator Robert F. Kennedy set into motion a round of legislative action that created the Special Impact Program, an amendment to the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964. He announced a seven point action plan that would serve as a national model for community development. The plan called for the formation of the Bedford Stuyvesant Renewal and Rehabilitation Corporation and the Development Services Corporation, involving assistance from some of the foremost leaders of the American business community. Under the leadership of Judge Thomas R. Jones, in 1967 the Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation (Restoration) was formally established to consolidate and carry forward these efforts. Deputy Police Commissioner Franklin A. Thomas, an original board member of the Bedford Stuyvesant Renewal and Rehabilitation Corporation and later to become President of the Ford Foundation, was elected as Restoration's first president. Initial funding support came from the Taconic Foundation, the Rockefeller Brothers Foundation, the Edgar M. Stern Family Fund, the J.M. Kaplan Fund and the Ford Foundation. One year later, Restoration purchased an abandoned milk bottling plant in the heart of Bedford Stuyvesant, Sheffield Farms, to serve as its new corporate headquarters. Renovations soon began to create what is now known as Restoration Plaza. Completed in 1972, today this 300,000 square feet commercial plaza is home to Restoration's headquarters, the historic Billie Holiday Theatre, the Skylight Gallery and scores of local businesses, non-profits and government agencies, including a post office, local branches of JPMorgan Chase, Washington Mutual Bank and Citibank, Super Foodtown, a satellite campus of the College of New Rochelle and Assemblywoman Annette Robinson's office. Since 1967, Restoration has catalyzed enormous economic, cultural, and educational improvements in Central Brooklyn. Just a sampling of our accomplishments include: <strong>Housing</strong>: Restoration has constructed or renovated 2,200 units of housing, including homeownership and rental. The corporation has also beautifully repaired the facades of 150 homes on 150 blocks and provided $60 million in mortgage financing to nearly 1500 homeowners. As the height of its activity, Restoration was the second largest real estate owner in Brooklyn after the City of New York and controlled over $12 million in fixed assets. Today, Restoration remains committed to creating a mixed income community where households of all income levels have access to quality housing. <strong>Economic Development</strong>: Restoration's programs have attracted more than $500 million in investments to Central Brooklyn: placed over 20,000 youth and adults in jobs, and catalyzed physical and economic improvements to Fulton Street. <strong>Arts and Culture</strong>: Our Youth Arts Academy remains the only comprehensive arts education institution in Bedford Stuyvesant. Together with art resident the Noel Pointer Foundation, the Academy , offers instruction in dance, music, and theatre to over 400 students ages 3-18 each year. The Skylight Gallery continues to feature artwork across media, showcasing the work of some 100 artists each year and drawing an average of 2,000 visitors. The Billie Holiday Theatre is still the only resource of its kind in Central Brooklyn, serving 30,000 people annually over a 36-week season. Winner of numerous Obie and AUDELCO awards, the Theatre is fertile ground for aspiring theatre professionals and an incredible community resource for residents interested in enjoying quality theatrical performances by critically acclaimed playwrights.

We have a track record of developing leadership among homeless people to impact policies and systems that affect their lives and our efforts have created space for homeless people, and their agenda, within the broader social justice movement.\nWe were founded by two homeless men in the Fall of 1999, Anthony Williams and Lewis Haggins, Jr. The catalyst for our founding was an urgent need to respond to the Giuliani administration's policy of criminalizing homeless people, broadly supported by the media. The co-founders of Picture the Homeless (PTH) began reaching out to allies for support, a place to meet and to figure out strategies to create an organization of homeless people that could carry out this work. In January 2000, PTH held its first organizing meeting. Picture the Homeless has since worked to develop an organization directed and run by homeless people by building an infrastructure that keeps organizational decision-making in the hands of homeless people.\nWe are a citywide, multiracial, bilingual organization and our constituency includes homeless people living in shelters as well as those living on the streets and in other public places. We serve a broad population of people because homelessness cuts across all boundaries: race, ethnicity, culture, gender, family composition, age, sexual orientation, language, etc., but what all homeless people have in common as a community is extreme poverty and social stigmatization. The vast majority of people in the NYC shelter system are Black and Latino/a, and many of them are women and children. There are currently nearly 40,000 people in the New York City shelter system, including over 9,000 families with over 18,000 children. These numbers do not include street-dwelling homeless people, or the hundreds of families waiting for placement in a shelter, or the estimated 350,000 doubled-up households throughout the city. Our outreach targets individuals from within the shelter system, as well as those who are unable/unwilling to live within it.",

Through our efforts last year we learned that our desire to create direct relationships between farmers and consumers cannot come to fruition without a strong team of volunteers who have the time to build community amongst the members and constantly educate and update the members about the farmland, the farmers, and the food they receive every week. Consequently, we are taking a break from managing the Farm Share and planning to spend the next year eating with our neighbors and exploring the new community food projects in our neighborhood. We hope that the energy we used to sustain the Bed-Stuy Farm Share the past eight years can be harnessed to engage with the neighborhood and determine what the future of this project should look like. We invite you to do the same and to keep us informed of your thoughts and desires for the future of this group.",

Lee and father, George Kim Lee. Following George's return from his Navy tour of duty during World War II, the farm began supplying New York's Chinatown with quality Asian produce grown in Melville, Long Island. The farm was expanded in the late 1950's to include year round production from Hobe Sound, Florida during the winter months. In 1964 the New York operation was moved to East Moriches, Long Island. Through the 1970's, '80's,and '90's, production and wholesale distribution expanded to Asian markets along the eastern coast from Montreal, Canada, to Miami, Florida, with many cities in between. As the markets changed and with the passing of some family members, Fred moved the farm operations in 1987 to Peconic, Southold, on the North Fork of Long Island. The moderate climate, offered by the location between The Long Island Sound and Peconic Bay, allows an extended growing season that capitalizes on the fertile, well drained sandy loam soils of eastern Long Island. During the early 1990's, the product line was expanded greatly to include specialty baby greens, herbs, mesclun and flowers. Today, Fred and his wife Karen operate the farm with their three children and staff growing more than 100 varietes of specialty vegetables, heirloom tomatoes, baby greens, mesclun, herbs,specialty Asian greens and flowers. Their goal is to provide the highest quality vegetables for their customers by growing unique fresh vegetables that are healthy and pleasing to the palate. Sang Lee Farms is and will continue to be environmentally responsible. They will accomplish this goal by cultivating their vegetables and herbs organically utilizing sustainable agricultural practices and integrated pest management. Sang Lee Farms will use only organically approved materials and production techniques to provide wholesome food for their community and customers. Sang Lee Farms is a Certified Organic Vegetable Farm by NOFA-NY Certified Organic, LLC. and will continue to cultivate their produce under the National Organic Production Standards to maintain certification with NOFA-NY.",

				"Description" : "From the Website: The Kitchen Table is a community kitchen and parenting collective for unschooling families committed to social change. We came up with the name The Kitchen Table as a way to keep our work focused around where we live and where we gather naturally. Our weekly community kitchen is a space where parents and neighbors, grandparents, elders and children can get involved in ways that are meaningful to them, cooking, creating, conversating, learning from one another through sharing skills and living life. The Kitchen Table is the seed of many things we each want to see it grow into, from an intergenerational learning collective to a cooperatively managed building, but for now it is a space where we can bring our children and unschool them. For us this means that we understand that our children are constantly learning, and trust them to choose to explore what is important to them. Instead of teaching, we create educational experiences that we share with our kids, allowing them to work and play with us as we grow and make food, create and fix things, have conflicts and resolve them, continually furthering our own learning. When we allow our children to be their own guides, we learn to see them as whole people with their own passions, not those dictated by a generic curriculum. And by working on our own projects, involving our kids when they are interested and allowing them to play when they are not, our children learn that adults, too, are whole people not just parents but artists, activists, gardeners, filmmakers, carpenters, tailors, entrepreneurs, educators, writers, dancers who enjoy living a good life. We fight daily with the pull of the capitalist society in which we live, that tells us it is more important to have stuff and credentials than it is to enjoy life. We value learning, eating and laughing over working over-time and getting good grades, and we believe our children have the right to these values too. Choosing to avoid institutional life like daycare, preschool and school can be very isolating for families and financially challenging making many unable to compete or even be recognized in the mainstream economy. We resist this isolation by creating opportunities for an alternate economy, a solidarity economy focused on work that has been previously rendered invisible or devalued but is central to our lives, like cooking and caring for our children. We create a barter economy by swapping one useful thing for another, skill sharing or exchanging time-based currency. Through this work we become a community of active, creative, and skilled people pooling and sharing parenting resources such as childcare, clothes, books and principles, philosophy, experience, while cooking healthy and delicious meals together. We believe that The Kitchen Table is revolutionary on many levels, in our daily lives, our communities, and the larger world. We actively and joyfully resist the idea that segregation by age and family status is healthy or normal, and the assumption that authoritarian schooling is necessary for growing up. We do this work so that our kids and everyone they encounter will question these assumptions and will learn that resisting oppressive institutions and creating community-based alternatives is not only possible, but really, really fun.

Through its programs and events, the Brecht Forum brings people together across social and cultural boundaries and artistic and academic disciplines to promote critical analysis, creative thinking, collaborative projects and networking in an independent community-level environment. The cornerstone of our educational conception situates movement-building within a transformative cultural process within society at large. From the beginning, our conception was based on the idea that a fundamental task of the left is to create, within existing society, a counter-hegemonic culture of working people and their allies, who are capable of challenging the capitalist agenda, prefiguring new ways of thinking and of self-organization, as well as creating new ways of relating to each other and nature. Throughout the year, we offer a wide-ranging program of classes, public lectures and seminars, art exhibitions, performances, popular education workshops, and language classes. These activities are developed in collaboration with the many social movements and the diverse communities of this most cosmopolitan of cities, and our programs bring together leading intellectuals, activists and artists from New York, across the U.S., and internationally. The Brecht Forum was founded in 1975 ashttp://brechtforum.org/nyms\\>The New York Marxist School.In 1984, the founding collective incorporated as The Brecht Forum with The New York Marxist School as the Forum's core project. Additional projects includehttp://brechtforum.org/institute\\>The Institute for Popular Education, founded in 1990 iin collaboration with thehttp://www.toplab.org/\\ target=\\_blank\\>Theater of the Oppressed Laboratory& Arts at the Brecht which includes ongoing arts programming in collaboration with such projects as Neues Kabarett, an experimental jazz series initiated in 1998,http://www.strikeanywhere.info/\\ target=\\_blank\\>Strike Anywhere Theater Ensemble, and The Ground Floor Collective. <strong>Registration & Fees</strong> Most of our activities have a sliding scale suggested donation and no one is turned away for inability to pay. As these funds only cover a portion of our costs, we ask all who can afford to give the higher amount to do so. Pre-registration is encouraged, but is not required except when indicated.<strong>Become a Brecht Forum SUBSCRIBER!</strong>With a pledge of $15 per month or more you can become a Brecht Forum Subscriber and receive a Subscriber Card entitling you to free admission to all classes (with the exception of language classes), lectures and discounts on selected seminars & special events",

				"Description" : "Seward Park Cooperative apartments are comprised of four 20-story buildings, with three towers in each building. The architects designed the buildings at an angle to Manhattan's grid, preserving many acres of green for shareholder enjoyment. This design gives the apartments ample light and provides many apartments with stunning views of midtown, downtown, and the bridges and water of the East River. Construction of Seward Park Cooperative began in 1959 under the sponsorship of the United Housing Foundation, a federation of cooperative housing societies, non-profit organizations and labor unions interested in promoting affordable housing. The cooperative was modeled after the successful completion in 1956 of the East River Housing Corporation, which was financed by the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union. There are two other union-sponsored cooperatives in the Grand Street area, including Hillman Houses built in 1950 and Amalgamated Dwellings completed in 1930. The four cooperatives were until recently collectively known as 'Co-op Village.\" For over three decades, Seward Park Cooperative operated as a limited-equity cooperative that allowed the co-op to receive tax subsidies for keeping the price of apartments at below market rates. In 1995, shareholders passed a Plan of Reconstitution converting Seward Park into a full-equity cooperative. Over a five year period the price ceilings were gradually lifted until they were completely abolished. Apartments throughout Co-op Village now sell at market rates. Seward Park Cooperative's history of affiliation with unions and a collectivist spirit are reflected in the distinctive murals in the lobbies of our four buildings. The murals were painted by Hugo Gellert, a prominent artist of the 1930s who is known for both his art and leftist politics. Gellert created murals for the 1939 World's Fair, a theater in Rockefeller Center, a cafeteria near Union Square, and an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art. Most of Gellert's public murals no longer exist. Having his work in the Seward Park lobbies is a tribute to the intellectual, cultural and political history of the Lower East Side.",

				"Description" : "From the Website: Sewing Rebellion NYC is the NY branch of Frau Fibers Sewing Rebellion. Two women, Amelia and Maya, founded the chapter, but then Amelia went on a never ending tour of the world and became our 'traveling corespondent'蕽, so Maya tends to be the one writing blog posts. That said, anyone who has joined us at a meeting or event, read an instruction sheet, earned a sewing patch (think girl scouts, only no cookies), or forwarded an email is also part of the crew. If you've taken a step towards learning or teaching about sewing in a political context (and yes, we strongly consider the personal to be political) then you're a member of SR. In 2011 we began a collaboration with the Textile Arts Center in south Brooklyn. Isa of TAC and Maya of SR joined forces to create The Mending Circle, a group that focuses specifically on mending (rather than the making) garments. The goal of Mending Circle is to develop our mending skills, literally mending our beloved and emotion-laden garments and metaphorically mending our frazzled, overworked, overbooked New York selves. What do we do? We teach folks to sew. We don't charge money for that. That's it, simple right?",
